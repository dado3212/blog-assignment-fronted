# Blog Assignment (Frontend) - CS52

### What it is

This was a project to create a fully working blog with frontend and backend.  The frontend used a React/Redux stack to handle all of the user interactions in creating users, logins, and creating/modifying/deleting posts.  The backend used Express and Mongo to create a RESTful API to interact with the frontend.  The entire project used Passport.js for authentication, in order to keep the backend and frontend user-protected.
